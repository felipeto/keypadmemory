#Calculator with Memory Feature
#Overview
This project is a web-based calculator designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers basic numerical input and arithmetic functions, along with a unique memory feature that allows users to store a number and receive visual feedback when subsequent inputs match or lead towards the stored number.

#Features
Memory Save: Use the memory button to save a button to memory
Input Matching Celebration: A celebration emoji is shown when the digits entered match the final number saved to memory
Full Match Celebration: Press "Enter" when the full number is entered. Confetti will show when guessed correctly
Clear Functionality: Pressing 'Clear' three times in a row without any intervening number inputs will clear the stored memory and make the memory button visible again.
